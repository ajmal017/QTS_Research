# QTS_Research
quant trading strategy research.
requirements: python 3 + numpy + pandas + matplotlib(optional)
copy the whole directory into your desired folder, modify Sample_Test.py and run it. remove the plot func if you not have matplotlib.
haven't got time to write documentation, but debug always works :)
